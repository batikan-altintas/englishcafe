EnglishCafe is one of the projects I did during  the course I took. While developing the application, I was inspired by one of the ideas of my flatmate, who is an advertiser, that has not been implemented in real life (maybe it will come true one day, who knows?) Simply put, the site brings together those who want to learn a language and those who want to teach, and while achieving this, it chooses public places as a meeting point. The application determines the places where lessons can be given, so it saves you from the troublesome problem of finding a spot.

There are 3 panels on the site. Only the admin can access the admin panel and can define a new language or place to the database from panel. Admin can also view existing appointments and confirm whether they happened or not.

In the teacher panel, teachers first designed appointments on appropriate dates. If these appointments are approved by the student, they fall into the active appointments section.

Students see the appointments defined by the teachers on student panel and decide to attend them. As soon as they approve, the appointment is now activated.

Technologies used: Visual Studio 2022, .Net Core 6, Entity Framework Core, MSSQL Server, HTML , CSS , Bootstrap and three lines of Javascript(for the flavor)
